# Conspiracy Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing the Conspiracy data collected from a survey conducted in the US in 2020. The survey aimed to explore people's beliefs regarding the conspiracy theory that Covid-19 was a Chinese bioweapon. The dataset used in this project is available in XML format, which can be opened with Excel. A detailed data description is also provided on Learn.

## Research Questions

The project seeks to answer the following questions:

1. Which type of people did not trust the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) during the Covid-19 pandemic? This question will be addressed using a suitable statistical model. The variable "trust_1" will be used to define the answers: 1 and 2 represent distrust, while 3 and 4 represent trust. (8 points)

2. Propose a prediction model to determine whether an individual fully trusts the CDC. For this analysis, respondents who answered 4 in the "trust_1" variable will be considered as having full trust in the CDC, and no full trust otherwise. (6 points)

## Methodology

In this project, statistical modeling and prediction techniques will be employed to address the research questions. The specific methods used will be motivated and explained in detail. The choice of models and methods will be based on their suitability for the given data and research objectives.

To answer the first question, a suitable statistical model will be selected to analyze the relationship between people's characteristics and their level of trust in the CDC during the Covid-19 pandemic. The variable "trust_1" will be transformed into a binary variable, with values 1 and 2 representing distrust, and values 3 and 4 representing trust.

For the second question, a prediction model will be proposed to classify individuals based on their level of trust in the CDC. The "trust_1" variable will be used to define the target variable, with individuals who answered 4 being classified as having full trust, and others classified as not having full trust.

## Limitations

During the analysis, it is important to consider potential limitations of the chosen methods. These limitations may include assumptions made by the models, the presence of outliers, or any other factors that could affect the validity and reliability of the results.

Furthermore, certain variables, such as the conspiracy-related variables (cons_*) and the survey weight (weight), will not be considered as input (feature) variables in the analysis. The exclusion of these variables will be justified based on the specific nature of the conspiracy variables and their relevance to the Covid-19 case.

Additionally, other variables may be excluded from the analysis if deemed necessary, provided that a reasonable motivation is provided for their exclusion.

Throughout the project, the findings will be discussed in detail, highlighting the insights gained, the significance of the chosen models and methods, as well as any limitations encountered during the analysis.
